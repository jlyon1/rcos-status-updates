## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I ordered parts, and developed a plan for physically turning the knob on the heater. Additionally I focused on how we will handle power distribution to the motor and Raspberry Pi. It is important to separate the power distribution.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on driving the motors from the Raspberry Pi. This will require using software PWM to specificy direction and speed for the motors. 

## Anything Blocking?

Currently blocked on parts, additionally, the distribution of Nerves we are using does not support the pi's hardware PWM driver.
