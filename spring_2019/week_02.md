## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I was able to drive the motors from the Raspberry Pi using software PWM. This is usedful because it means we will be able to run a Nerves application that can drive the motors.

## This Week's Plan

This week I intend to figure out how to fixate the stepper to the knob. This will involve some form of either 3d printed or lazer cut gear as well as a mount to attach the motor to the heater.

## Anything Blocking?

Currently not blocked, other than figuring out what specifications to design the parts to in order to attach the motor to the heater.
