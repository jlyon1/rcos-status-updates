## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week I ordered parts, and developed a plan for physically turning the knob on the heater. Additionally I focused on how we will handle power distribution to the motor and Raspberry Pi. It is important to separate the power distribution.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week I plan on driving the motors from the Raspberry Pi. This will require using software PWM to specificy direction and speed for the motors. 

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Currently blocked on parts, additionally, the distribution of Nerves we are using does not support the pi's hardware PWM driver.
