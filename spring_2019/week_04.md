## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I contributed to a few Web Tech projects by reviewing Grace's PR on pettitions: https://github.com/wtg/petitions-rewrite/pull/25 and contributing to new features on the shuttle tracker, specifically a joint effort with Sidney Kochman, bus button https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/207. Additionally, I reviewed another PR to add routes to shuttle popups. https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker/pull/206.

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to continue to contribute to the various WebTech projects.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking code wise, expecting a busy schedule.
