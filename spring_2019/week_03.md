## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I shifted into working on a few other open source projects, including contributions to the WebTech Group's Elections project [here](https://github.com/wtg/elections, the Electnoms Project [here](https://github.com/wtg/elecnoms) and the Shuttle Tracker [here](https://github.com/wtg/shuttletracker). These contributions included several changes to how the Elections site and elecnoms service interact in order to reflect new changes in the elections policy for this year. In addition, I reviewed several shuttle tracker pull requests including:
- Fix Google Analytics (#203)
- Center routes on map; set vehicle routes sooner (#202)
- Use icon from propaganda repo (#201)
- Shuttle Tracker Fusion (#200)
- Turn Shuttle Tracker into a Go module (#198)

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan on focusing more on reviewing contributions to the elections site project as several more changes need to be implemented. In addiiton, I will be focusing on improving branding of several WebTech projects. I am expecting to review a few more pull requests on the shuttle tracker as well as on the elecnoms and elections services.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking code wise, expecting a busy schedule.
