## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I contributed to several webtech projects, including creating the wtg identity service (https://github.com/wtg/identity) and the shuttle tracker. I reviewd a few different PRs. Additionally, I contributed to my SDD project VoteRight (https://github.com/voteright/voteright).

## This Week's Plan

This week I plan to continue to contribute to the various WebTech projects, and finish reviewing people's PRs.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking code wise, expecting a busy schedule.
